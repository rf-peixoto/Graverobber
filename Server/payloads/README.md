Here the compiled (and/or alternative) payloads for their respective platforms must be placed. They should be ready for use by the [trail-blazer](https://github.com/rf-peixoto/Graverobber/blob/main/Source/trail-blazer.py).

**qv1m3r4:** Minimal payload, no built-in encryption tool.

**river_lethe:** Data eraser, does not leave files encrypted and deletes itself after attack.

**count_zero:** Mixed stuff with encryption optimizations. It does not have a built-in recovery tool.
